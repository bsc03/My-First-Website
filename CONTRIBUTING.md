Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. 
As we continue to collaborate on our project,
I'd like to introduce a few guidelines to streamline
our development process and ensure consistency in our work.

Individual GitHub Account:
Going forward, I encourage each developer to create and use their own GitHub Account for contributing to our project.
This approach will provide a clear structure for individual contributions and make it easier to manage changes.

Bootstrap for Styling:
To maintain a consistent and responsive design across our project,
we have decided to use Bootstrap for styling. 
Please integrate Bootstrap into your work and ensure 
that the styling aligns with our project's overall aesthetic.
This will help us present a unified and professional appearance.
